AI-Based Brain Tumor Detection and Classification in MRI Scans
Overview
This project leverages deep learning techniques to detect and classify brain tumors from MRI scan images. The model is trained on a dataset of MRI images with labeled tumor types and can accurately distinguish between normal and abnormal brain tissues. This repository contains the necessary code, datasets, and model for automatic brain tumor detection and classification.

Features
Preprocessing of MRI Scans: Converts raw MRI images into a standardized format for analysis.
Tumor Detection: Identifies the presence of tumors in brain MRI scans.
Tumor Classification: Classifies detected tumors into different categories (e.g., glioma, meningioma, pituitary, etc.).
Visualization: Provides visualization of detected tumors using bounding boxes and heatmaps.
Performance Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of MRI brain scans with labeled tumor types. The dataset can be found here (provide link). Each MRI scan is associated with a label that indicates whether the patient has a brain tumor and, if so, what type of tumor.

Project Architecture
Data Preprocessing: MRI images are preprocessed (resizing, normalization, augmentation) to ensure consistency in input.
Model Architecture: A deep learning model (e.g., CNN) is used to classify the images. The architecture is optimized for both detection and classification.
Training: The model is trained on the labeled MRI dataset.
Evaluation: The model is evaluated on a separate test set to determine accuracy, precision, and other metrics.
Model
We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for tumor detection and classification. Some key layers include:

Convolutional layers for feature extraction.
Max-pooling layers for dimensionality reduction.
Fully connected layers for classification.
